# Vanna MCP Server - Phase 2 Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed in Phase 2

### Training & Data Integration Tools
- ✅ Implemented `vanna_train` tool (Priority #2)
  - Supports three training types: DDL, documentation, and SQL
  - Includes mandatory validation for SQL queries
  - Performs dry run with LIMIT 1 for safety
  - Stores training history
  - Returns success status with suggestions
  
- ✅ Created BigQuery DDL extraction script
  - Extracts DDL from BigQuery tables
  - Enhances DDL with metadata from data catalog
  - Respects access control settings (whitelist/blacklist)
  - Integrates table and column descriptions as SQL comments
  
- ✅ Implemented `vanna_suggest_questions` tool (Priority #3)
  - Analyzes training data to suggest relevant questions
  - Supports context filtering (table, dataset, topic)
  - Categorizes questions (aggregation, ranking, time-series, etc.)
  - Includes metadata about why questions were suggested
  - Generates DDL-based suggestions

### Supporting Scripts
- ✅ Created `load_initial_training.py` script
  - Validates configuration before loading
  - Shows accessible datasets
  - Confirms with user before processing
  - Loads DDL and metadata into Vanna
  - Provides summary of results

### Server Updates
- ✅ Registered `vanna_train` tool in server.py
- ✅ Registered `vanna_suggest_questions` tool in server.py
- ✅ Updated imports and type hints

## 🚧 In Progress / Unclear Status

### Data Catalog Integration
- The DDL extraction script exists and references `metadata_data_dictionary`
- ⚠️ Unclear if BigQuery metadata integration actually works
- Need to run `load_initial_training.py` to populate Vanna with data

## 📋 Phase 2 Checklist

- [x] Implement `vanna_train` tool
- [x] Create BigQuery DDL extraction script
- [⚠️] Integrate data catalog metadata into DDL (script exists but untested)
- [x] Implement `vanna_suggest_questions` tool
- [x] Update server.py with new tools
- [x] 🆕 Implement `vanna_list_tenants` tool (not in original plan)
- [ ] Run initial data load (requires BigQuery setup)
- [x] Test all implemented tools (done during multi-tenant testing)

## 🔧 Next Steps for User

1. **Ensure configuration is complete**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/mohit/claude/ai-data-analyst-mcp/vanna-mcp-server
   python scripts/test_setup.py
   ```

2. **Set up database if not done**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/setup_database.py
   # Copy SQL and run in Supabase
   ```

3. **Load initial training data**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/load_initial_training.py
   # Or limit to first 10 tables for testing:
   python scripts/load_initial_training.py 10
   ```

4. **Test the server with new tools**:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

## 📊 Tools Implemented So Far

1. **vanna_ask** (Priority #1) ✅
   - Natural language to SQL conversion
   - Returns SQL, explanation, confidence
   - Tracks query history

2. **vanna_train** (Priority #2) ✅
   - Add training data (DDL, documentation, SQL)
   - Validates SQL queries before training
   - Suggests related training

3. **vanna_suggest_questions** (Priority #3) ✅
   - Suggests questions based on training data
   - Context-aware filtering
   - Categorizes questions

## 🎯 Remaining Tools (Priority Order)

4. **vanna_explain** - Explain SQL queries in plain English
5. **vanna_execute** - Execute SQL and return results
6. **vanna_get_schemas** - List available schemas/tables
7. **vanna_get_training_data** - View/export training data
8. **vanna_remove_training** - Remove incorrect training
9. **vanna_generate_followup** - Generate follow-up questions

## 🆕 Additional Features Implemented (Not in Original Plan)

- **Multi-tenant isolation** - Complete security implementation
- **Cross-tenant blocking** - Pre-query validation
- **Metadata-based filtering** - Using PostgreSQL JSONB
- **`vanna_list_tenants` tool** - For tenant management
- **Production-ready configuration** - No hardcoded credentials

## 📝 Notes

- All tools follow the established pattern with comprehensive documentation
- Validation is mandatory for SQL training
- ✅ The system uses configurable schema via `VANNA_SCHEMA` setting (defaults to "public")
- Our fork supports custom schemas, unlike original Vanna which was limited to public
- Access control is via ALLOWED_TENANTS config, not database table
- Ready to proceed with Phase 3 (Query Execution & Visualization)
